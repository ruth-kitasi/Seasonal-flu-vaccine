### Introduction
The occurrence of the flu season repeats annually, and each year people make a choice to either receive the flu shot or not.
This attempts to develop a predictive model to forecast individuals' decision to receive the flu shot or not during the annual flu season 

### Problem statement
The aim of the proÄ¯ect is to assist in public health planning and decision-making by providing insights into vaccination trends and helping allocate resources effectively to the United States government health Agencies


### Main Objective 
Create a model that can predict seasonal flu vaccine uptake based on a person's background and patterns of behavior

### Important features

### Models
- Logical Regression
- Decision trees

### Evaluation
- confusion matrix
- ROC AUC

### Conclusions

- Personal opinion about the vaccine greatly affects the uptake

- Errors  minimized using the logical regression model.

- The comparison between the logical regression an the decision tree model shows that logical regression is a better-performing model.

### Recommendations
- Careful examination of the significance of identified predictors	will help understand underlying factors and ensure fairness in decision-making.
 
- Include a wider range of demographic groups, thereby achieving a more diverse and balanced dataset.

- Regularly review and update the model to ensure it adapts to new data and trends.
